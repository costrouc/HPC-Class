CS 596 - Homework Assignment #1
All code and documentation was written by Chris Ostrouchov (costrouc@utk.edu)

REQUIREMENTS
=============
cBLAS - My homework assignment uses BLAS to check the correctness of each each problem (2-norm, matrix-vector multiply, matrix-matrix multiply)
PAPI - A library maintained by UTK. I use PAPI for timing, counting of flips, and flops/sec. It has been a great learning experience using this library

INSTALL
=============
To install simple use the make command

      make

EXECUTABLE
=============
Usage
	./hw1 <min_size> <max_size>

By running the command with <min_size> and <max_size> the program will do the following:

 - Calculate 2-norm for random vectors with values uniformly distributed between the closed interval [0.0 - 1.0]
 - Verify each 2-norm for random vectors with BLAS Level 1 implementation

 - Calculate matrix-vector product for random vector and matrix with values uniformly distributed between the closed interval [0.0 - 1.0]
 - Verify each matrix-vector product for random vector and matrix with BLAS Level 2 implementation

 - Calculate matrix-vector product for random matrices with values uniformly distributed between the closed interval [0.0 - 1.0]
 - Verify each matrix-matrix product for random matrices with BLAS Level 2 implementation

Memory usage:
BEWARE OF LARGE <max_size> input. Memory usage scales as (max_size * max_size * 2 * 8) bytes.

TESTING
=============
make test

runs the test asked for in the homework 1 - 1000.

FOLDERS
=============
src - contains source files
utils - contains python script to plot data created from ./hw1
doc - where homework document is written
data - where data from ./hw1 executable is written to
img - where images from plot.py (make plot) is stored

MAKE COMMANDS
=============
make - install executable
make test - run tests (takes around 15 minutes)
make plot - create plots from data
make clean - clean src directory and executable
make clean_data - clean data and images produced by running the executable
make purge - clean folders of backups
make release - tarball folder
