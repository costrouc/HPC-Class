CS 596 - Homework Assignment #2
All code and documentation was written by Chris Ostrouchov (costrouc@utk.edu)

REQUIREMENTS
=============
(c)BLAS / LAPACK(E) - My homework assignment uses BLAS to check the correctness . LAPACK documents how to mesure error [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/node75.html]. We use the Frobenius Norm.
PAPI - A library maintained by UTK. I use PAPI for timing, counting of flips, and flops/sec. It has been a great learning experience using this library

INSTALL
=============
To install simple use the make command

      make

EXECUTABLE
=============
Usage
	./hw3

By running the command the program will do the following:

 - Calculate the Cholesky QR factorization of an m by n matrix A
 - Verify each QR factorization by testing norm(I-Q'Q ) and norm(A-AR)

Memory Usage (yeah i didn't optimize)
~O(7n^2)
 
TESTING
=============
make test

runs the test asked for in the homework with matricies of size 1000\32 2000\32 3000\32

FOLDERS
=============
src - contains source files
doc - where homework document is written
data - where example data from my ./hw3 executable  

MAKE COMMANDS
=============
make - compile executable
make test - run tests (takes around 15 minutes)
make clean - clean src directory and executable
make purge - clean folders of backups
make release - tarball folder
